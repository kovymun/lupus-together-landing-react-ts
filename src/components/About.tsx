                Lupus Together is a safe and welcoming space for people living
                with lupus, their families, and their friends. Whether you are
                newly diagnosed, living with lupus for years, or caring for
                someone who is, this is where connection begins.

                We started in 2012 in Cape Town South Africa. A small group of
                friends came together, each with someone close to them affected
                by lupus. What began as a few honest conversations quickly grew
                into something more. A place where people could be seen, heard,
                and supported without judgment.

              Lupus Together was created so no one has to face this condition in
