          <h2>About Lupus Together</h2>

          <p>
            Welcome to Lupus Together, a place where you'll find support,
            understanding, and friendship.
          </p>

          <p>
            We're a peer-led support initiative founded in 2012 by a group of
            close friends, each with family touched by Lupus. Born from the need
            for real connection and helpful resources, we offer a safe,
            supportive space for everyone navigating life with Lupus, whether
            you're newly diagnosed or have been living with it for years.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our mission is to connect, uplift, and empower people affected by
            Lupus by sharing stories, strength, and community.
          </p>

          <p>
            We're here so no one has to face Lupus alone. Through support,
            empathy, and guidance, we help each other find light during the
            toughest days.
          </p>

          <p>
            What makes us different? Our heart-first approach. While others
            inform, we listen. While others post, we engage. Lupus Together is
            more than a community - it's a movement built on compassion,
            inclusion, and resilience.
          </p>
