### Description and Purpose

Lupus Together is a front-end landing page built with care, empathy, and intention. Inspired by a loved one's journey with Lupus, this project serves as a heartfelt digital space for awareness, connection, and support.

Built using React, TypeScript, and Vanilla CSS for the frontend, and Django with Django REST Framework for the backend, it follows landing page best practices while providing a secure, reliable, and scalable API. The backend handles data storage, input validation, and safe communication with the frontend, ensuring user submissions are processed correctly and securely.

This personal project combines thoughtful UI/UX with meaningful storytelling to gently educate, uplift, and welcome future members into a compassionate community.

### Features

1. Smooth, intuitive navigation using **React Scroll** for section-based browsing.
2. **Fully responsive design** for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
3. Content-first layout designed to raise awareness and build community.
4. Modern CSS techniques, including **Flexbox**, **Grid**, and `clamp()` for fluid typography.
5. **Light and dark mode themes** that automatically adapt to the user’s system preference, improving accessibility and comfort.
6. **Form and input validation** with React Hook Form on the frontend and DRF serializers on the backend, ensuring all user-submitted data meets required criteria before reaching the database.
7. **Secure POST requests** with a **shared secret token handshake** between the _frontend_ and _backend_, ensuring only trusted clients can submit data and preventing unauthorized or automated (bot) submissions.

### Security

#### Backend Security Measures

| Security Feature                         | Description                                                                                   | Why                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend–Backend Shared Secret Token** | The frontend includes a secret key stored in `.env`. The backend verifies it on each request. | Ensures only trusted frontend clients can access the API. |
| **Serializer Validation**                | All data passes through DRF serializers before saving.                                        | Prevents malformed or malicious data.                     |
| **CSRF & CORS Middleware**               | Default Django middleware enabled.                                                            | Restricts cross-origin and CSRF attacks.                  |
| **Environment Variables**                | Secrets and credentials stored in `.env`.                                                     | Protects sensitive information from exposure.             |

### Testing

#### Back-end testing (Django + Pytest)

#### Integration tests:

This section tracks backend tests as they are added. Each test includes a short reason and a status to keep things easy to follow.

### Backend Testing Summary

| Test Type                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                            | Result |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| Model test                        | Confirms that the CommunityMember model can be created, behaves as expected, and that user details are saved to the database correctly.                                                | PASSED |
| Serializer validation tests       | Ensures that the CommunityMemberSerializer correctly validates input data, enforcing required fields and constraints. Includes checks for missing fields like first_name or last_name. | PASSED |
| Views test                        | Confirms that the `/community/` endpoint correctly handles GET and POST requests with both valid and invalid data.                                                                     | PASSED |
| POST request duplicate email test | Verifies that submitting a POST request with an email that already exists in the database returns a validation error and prevents duplicate entries.                                   | PASSED |

#### Security Tests:

| Test Name                                          | Description                                                                                                                   | Why It’s Useful                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Result |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| **Frontend–Backend Shared Secret Token Handshake** | Verified that requests with the correct shared secret token succeed, and invalid or missing tokens return `401 Unauthorized`. | Protects the backend from unauthorized requests or bots, ensures only your frontend or trusted clients can submit data to sensitive endpoints, and adds a lightweight layer of security even without full user authentication. | PASSED |
